## State Transition Technique: ##

i) Using state transition testing, we pick test cases from an application where we need to test different system transitions. 

ii) We can apply this when an application gives a different output for the same input, depending on what has happened in the earlier state. 

**Example:** 

Login with invalid username and password three times keeps the account page blocked until change password.
