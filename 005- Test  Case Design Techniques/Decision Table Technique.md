## Decision Table Technique: ##

- In Decision table technique, we deal with combinations of inputs. 

- To identify the test cases with decision table, we consider conditions and actions.           

- We take conditions as inputs and actions as outputs. 

**Example:** 

Login validation - Allow user to login only when both the username and password is correct. 

Conditions 1: Enter valid username and valid password and Click Login. o Actions 1: Display home page and Execute. 

Conditions 2: Enter invalid username and valid password and Click Login. o Actions 2: Display Error message as invalid username.
