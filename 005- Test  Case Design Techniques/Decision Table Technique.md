- **Decision Table Technique:**

`         `In Decision table technique, we deal with combinations of inputs. 

`         `To identify the test cases with decision table, we consider conditions and actions.           

`         `We take conditions as inputs and actions as outputs. 

Example: Login validation - Allow user to login only when both the username and password is correct. 

` `Conditions 1: Enter valid username and valid password and Click Login. o Actions 1: Display home page and Execute. 

` `Conditions 2: Enter invalid username and valid password and Click Login. o Actions 2: Display Error message as invalid username.
