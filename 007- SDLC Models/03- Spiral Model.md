**Spiral Model Basics:**

- Imagine the Spiral Model like a coiled spring, with each loop representing a phase in making the software.
- It's like taking a cautious journey around a spiral, making the software better with each loop.

**How Spiral Model Works:**

- Start at the centre, where we figure out what the software should do and plan how to do it.
- Then, we take a loop around the spiral, doing a bit of designing and coding.
- After each loop, we check if what we did is good (like testing it).
- If it's good, we can move to the next loop and add more features or improvements. If not, we fix it before moving on.
- We keep looping, making the software better each time until it's just right.
- We use the Spiral Model for big projects where we want to be careful and keep making things better with each turn.

|**Advantage**|**Disadvantage**|
| :- | :- |
|Flexible changes are allowed in spiral model.|It is not suitable for the small and low-risk product because it could be costly for a smaller project.|
|The development can be distributed into smaller parts.|It is a traditional model, and thus developers only did the testing job as well.|
|The customer can use the application at an early stage also.|There is no requirement of review process and no parallel deliverables allowed in the spiral model.|
|More clarity for Developers and Test engineers|In the spiral model, management is a bit difficult; that's why it is a complex process.|
|It will provide the wide use of prototypes.|The maximum number of intermediate phases needs unnecessary paperwork.|
