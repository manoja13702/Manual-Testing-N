**Waterfall Model:**

- The Waterfall Model is the starting point for making software.
- It's like following steps in order: one step at a time.
- Each step uses what was made in the step before. It's like building blocks, one on top of the other.

**How Waterfall Model Works:**

- Finish one step before going to the next; no jumping around.
- Every step gives something needed for the next step, like passing a baton in a relay race.
- We often use this for very important things like hospital apps or military projects, where we need to be super careful and follow a clear path.

|**Pros**|**Cons**|
| :- | :- |
|In the Waterfall model, the requirement should be clear.|This model has no parallel deliverable, which means that two teams can work together.|
|It is suitable for a smaller project where needs are well understood.|The waterfall model doesn't provide the requirement changes and requirement review.|
|This model is easy to understand, as well as easy to use.|Previously, when the waterfall is invented, there is no concept of testing, that's why the developer is used to test the application.|
|It will allow us to arrange the tasks efficiently.|In between, changes are not allowed because one phase is dependent on another stage.|
|In this model, release level changes are allowed.|Backward tracking is not possible.|
|In this model, the procedure and the results are well documented.|It is a time-consuming process.|
