**Agile Model Basics:**

- The Agile model is like building a puzzle, where each piece is small and fits perfectly into the whole picture.
- It's about being flexible, collaborating, and adapting to changes quickly.

**How Agile Model Works:**

- First, we gather a bunch of puzzle pieces (requirements) and spread them out on the table (planning).
- Then, we start by picking a piece that stands out (prioritize a small part of the project).
- We try fitting that piece into the bigger picture (develop and integrate a small feature).
- If it fits well, we pick another piece and fit it in (repeat with more features).
- If a piece doesn't fit perfectly, we adjust it slightly until it fits just right (iterate and refine the feature).
- We keep doing this until all the pieces are put together, and we have a complete puzzle (a fully functional software product).
