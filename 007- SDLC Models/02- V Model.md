**V-Model Basics:**

- The V-Model is like a smarter version of the Waterfall Model.
- It's like taking steps, but with testing at every step to catch problems early.
- The steps look like a 'V', starting with planning and ending with testing and delivery.

**How V-Model Works:**

- Like the Waterfall, but with a testing buddy at each step to check the work.
- For every step down, there's a corresponding step up for testing and verification, like a double-check.
- We use the V-Model for important projects where we need to be really careful and sure about the software, just like in hospitals or military systems.

|**Advantage**|**Disadvantage**|
| :- | :- |
|In this, review exists in every phase, that's why we may get less number of bugs in the application.|It is a bit expensive process because Initial investment is high as the testing team is needed from the starting stage itself.|
|The V model provides the Parallel deliverable, which implies that the two teams can work together like here; the development and testing team are working parallelly.|It is a time-consuming process because if requirement changes happen, we need to change every text documents.|
|This model helps to deliver Robust or stable products.|In this, we need to do more documentation work because of the test cases and all other documents.|
|In this model, the test Engineers have more knowledge about the product because testing is involved in every stage of product development.|The V model is not suitable for object-oriented projects.|
|The text document can be re-used.|We cannot go back and replace the functionality once the application is in the testing phase.|
