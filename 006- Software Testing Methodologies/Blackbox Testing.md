## Black-box Testing. ##

Black-box testing, also known as functional testing, treats the software application as a “Black-box” whose internal workings are not known to the tester. Testers who perform black-box testing focus on testing the application’s inputs, outputs and functionality without any knowledge of the underlying code.

**Key Characteristics of black-box testing:**

1) Focuses on testing the application’s external behaviour.
1) Doesn’t require knowledge of the internal code or implementation details.
1) Test cases are designed based on requirements, specifications or user stories.
1) Aims to validate that the software meets specified requirements and functions correctly.
1) Can uncover issues related to incorrect functionality, usability and performance.

**Real time example:**

Consider testing a search engine. Testers would input various search queries and evaluate the results without knowing how the search algorithm operates. The focus is on validating the accuracy and relevance of the search results.
