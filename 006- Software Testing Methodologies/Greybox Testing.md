## Grey-box Testing. ##

Grey-box testing is a combination of both white-box and black-box testing. Testers who perform grey-box testing have partial knowledge of this internal code and design but not a comprehensive understanding. This approach allows testers to design test cases based on both functional specifications and some insights into the code structure.



**Key Characteristics of grey-box testing:**



1) Combines elements of both white-box and black-box testing.
1) Testers have limited knowledge of the internal code and design.
1) Aims to strike a balance between code coverage and functional testing.
1) Can be particularly effective for integration testing and security testing.
1) Requires some programming skills and familiarity with the codebase.

**Real time example:**

Suppose you're testing an e-commerce website. You have access to the database structure (white box knowledge) and use this knowledge to design tests to validate the checkout process and ensure the system properly updates the inventory and customer records (black box testing).
