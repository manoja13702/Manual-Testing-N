**White-box Testing.**

`                                       `White-box testing, also known as clear-box testing or structural testing, involves examining the internal logic and code structure of a software application. Testers who perform white-box testing have knowledge of the internal workings of the code such as the source code, algorithms, data structures and program flow. This knowledge allows them to design test cases that target specific paths, conditions and branches within the code.

**Key Characteristics of white-box testing:**

1) Focuses on code coverage and internal logic.
1) Involves testing individual code components, functions and methods.
1) Aims to ensure that all possible code paths are tested.
1) Can uncover coding errors, logic flaws and improper use of data structures.
1) Requires programming skills and understanding of the codebase.

**Real time example:**

`                                 `When testing a software login system, white box testing involves designing test cases to verify that the system handles valid and invalid credentials, processes login requests, and triggers appropriate actions based on the inputs.
