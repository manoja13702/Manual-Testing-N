**Manual testing:**

**Definition:** 

Manual Testing involves human testers manually executing test cases without the use of automation tools or scripts.

**Process:**

- Testers create test cases based on requirements and execute them manually.
- They explore the application, checking for usability, functionality, and other aspects.
- Testers document defects and report them for further investigation and resolution.

**Flexibility:**

- More adaptable to ad-hoc and exploratory testing.
- Ideal for early development stages when the application interface is not stable.

**Examples:**

- A tester manually clicks through an application to ensure all links and buttons work as expected.
- Exploratory testing, where testers freely explore the application to identify unexpected behaviours.

**Automation Testing:**

**Definition:**

Automation testing involves using automated tools and scripts to perform test cases and validate software functionality.

**Process:**

- Testers write scripts to automate the execution of test cases.
- The automation tool interacts with the application, comparing actual outcomes with expected results.
- Provides quicker feedback and can run repetitive tests efficiently.

**Efficiency & Reusability:**

- ` `Highly efficient for repetitive test cases, regression testing, and large-scale applications.
- Test scripts can be reused for multiple test cycles, saving time and effort.

**Examples:**

- Automating login functionality to validate user authentication using Selenium WebDriver.
- Automating a shopping cart checkout process to ensure a smooth transaction using tools like Appium.
