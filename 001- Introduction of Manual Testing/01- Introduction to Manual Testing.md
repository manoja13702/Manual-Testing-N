**Introduction to Manual Testing:**

`             `Manual testing is the process of evaluating software or an application manually to identify defects and ensure its functionality meets specified requirements. Testers follow predefined test cases or explore the application to validate various aspects such as features, usability, and performance. This type of testing involves human intervention without the use of automated testing tools. 

**Example:** 

`              `Imagine you're testing a new e-commerce website. In manual testing, you would interact with the website as a user, navigating through different pages, adding items to the cart, filling out forms, and ensuring that the website behaves as expected at each step. You might test different payment methods, verify shipping options, and confirm that the order is successfully placed. If any issues or unexpected behaviour are found, you would report them for further investigation and resolution.
