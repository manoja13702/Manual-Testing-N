## Acceptance testing: ##

**Definition:**

Acceptance Testing evaluates whether the software meets the business requirements and if it's ready for deployment.

**Real time example:**

Before deploying a new release of a social media application, end-users and product owners conduct acceptance testing to confirm that new features, such as a redesigned user profile, meet the expectations and work smoothly.
