## Retesting: ##

**Definition:** 

Retesting is the process of executing the failed test cases again after the defects identified in earlier testing have been fixed.

**Real time example:**

Suppose during system testing of a social media application, you found a defect where a user's profile picture was not displaying correctly. The development team fixes this issue, and you retest the specific test cases related to profile picture display to confirm that the defect has been successfully addressed.
