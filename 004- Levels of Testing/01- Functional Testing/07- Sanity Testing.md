## Sanity Testing: ##

**Definition:**

Sanity Testing is a quick, focused test to confirm that a specific functionality or area of the software is working correctly after changes or bug fixes.

**Real Time Example:** 

Imagine you're working on an e-commerce website. After making several updates to the payment processing system, you perform a sanity test by placing a test order to ensure that the payment process is functioning properly and that customers can successfully make transactions.
